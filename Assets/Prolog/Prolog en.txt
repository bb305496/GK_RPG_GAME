He was born the son of a peasant, but fate had different plans for him. His talent for combat made him a knight, and his heart a loyal servant of justice. Yet he never forgot where he came from—he knew that the blood of common folk was just as precious as that of kings. He believed in the code, but the code did not protect him from betrayal.

Darkness shrouded the knight’s mind as poison coursed through his veins. The traitor’s blade had not pierced his armor, but the venomous essence seeped into his body, trapping him in a world where the line between dreams and reality dissolves into chaos. A world where shadows take on familiar shapes, and whispering voices echo the past.

The knight dreams—but it is a dream from which he cannot wake. He wanders through a labyrinth of his own fears, facing the monsters that rise from his soul. If he defeats them, he may yet find his way back. If he fails… he will remain here forever.
